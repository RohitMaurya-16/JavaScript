/* You want a program where:

It runs continuously.

If user enters a number that is a multiple of 5 (or any number you choose), it should print it.

If user enters a wrong number (not a multiple), then first time it gives the power/square result.

Next wrong entry, it should exit.

But if after a wrong entry, the next input is again a multiple, the game should continue. */
